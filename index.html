					# Example Project

					## Mapping Access

					Note:
					To demonstrate how I work, I will share with you this example mapping project that I worked on for
					five years.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Statement Of Work

					Create a reusable solution to collect, convert, and aggregate spatial data working with a team
					across two offices that reports the output data multiple times a year for five years.

					Note:
					This was a long way to say show us areas where people have access to the data providers services in
					the U.S.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Variables

					- stake holders
					- proprietary information
					- data providers
					- team members
					- output formats
					- reporting dates

					Note:
					Each variable is a multiplier on the number issues the solution needs to satisfy to be succesful

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Reporting Standards

					- Tiger block polygons for urban areas
					- Tiger road polylines for rural areas

					Note:
					Census Tiger data is a common standard for U.S. demographics. It is both a blessing and a curse do
					variations from decade to decade from changing block boundaries and road networks.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Conflation

					The merging of two or more sets of
					information, texts, ideas, etc. into one.
					-Google Dictionary

					Note:
					Combining data is tricky because you risk the chance of mis-representing the source information in
					your output.

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					# Geospatial Input Data

					- Point data representing homes with access
					- Polygons representing areas with access
					- Lines representing roads with access

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Issue #1

					## Road to Road Conflation

					![Issue 1](./img/issue_1.png "Issue 1")

					Note:
					Data providers used multiple reference system geometries for the road linework. Alignment of
					geometry or 1:1 relationship caused issues.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Issue #1

					## Solutions

					- Buffer provided segment and then join to Tiger segments that are within buffer
					- Snap provided segment end points or vertices to Tiger segments then join overlapping geometries
					- Convert provided segments to center points and then join to nearest Tiger segment

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Issue #1

					## Reasoning and Research

					- Buffering segments does not work if new segments along a road are smaller than the potentially
					associated Tiger geometry
					- There is no way to set a proper tolerance for snapping to Tiger geometry
					- Center points are not exact, but they can represent 1:* relationships and can assign data from new
					roads to nearest segment in Tiger geometry

				</section>
			</section>
			<section id="tabular">
				<section data-markdown>
					# Tabular Input Data

					- x,y representing homes
					- census tiger ids

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Issue #2

					## Processing x,y points

					![Issue 2](./img/issue_2.png "Issue 2")

					Note:
					x,y point data commonly uses decimal degree latitude and longitude coordinates and Tiger Data is in
					NAD 83 feet.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Issue #2

					## Solutions

					- Convert all incoming data into NAD83 before processing
					- Convert all reference data into WGS83 before processing

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Issue #2

					## Reasoning and Research

					- Each provider data set sent will need o be converted to NAD83, makig this a time sync
					- Only the output data will need the original source geometry from Tiger, so geometry can be
					rejoined by
					block or road id when reporting
					- None of the provider data we looked at came in as NAD83. The majority of the data, both tabular
					and
					geospatial was in lat/lon coordinates

					# Issue #3

					## What tools should I use?

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Issue #3

					## Workflow Design Goals

					- modular tools
					- self documenting process
					- accessible for GIS Analysts

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Issue #3.1.0

					## Use FME Desktop

					- Develop reusable processing models quickly
					- Conversion models act as documentation
					- Limited licenses available

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Issue #3.2.0

					## Use ArcGIS Data Interoperability extension

					- Floating licenses available
					- Toolset accessible through familiar ArcGIS
					- Editing environment buggy and loses model updates

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Issue #3.3.0

					## Use ArcGIS Model Builder

					- Can build reusable models
					- Models are self documenting and can be stored with processed data
					- Models get too complicated and fail when using variables

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Issue #3.3.1

					## Use ArcGIS Arcpy Scripts

					- Can build reusable scripts
					- Not self documenting when run
					- Not familiar to GIS Analysts

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Issue #3.3.2

					## Use ArcGIS Model Builder and Arcpy Scripts Tools

					- Can build reusable scripts
					- Models add self documentation and are stored with processing data
					- GIS Analysts can use Model Builder to access Python scripts

				</section>

			<section id=conclusion>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Conclusion

					## Results

					- Time spent processing data improved with each round by at least 25%
					- Documentation of process allowed for auditing providers for QC
					- Modular design allowed for new scripts to be added to the workflow when needed
